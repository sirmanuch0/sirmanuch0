- ðŸ‘‹ Hello, Iâ€™m Manuh. I'm glad and excited that you made it to my other Github. 
- :grin: I've been a crypto enthusiast for a long time but only made the jump to learning programming in the crypto space this year. I originally took a Cybersecurity course online last year but the workload was incredibly difficult for someone with no programming experience. I took a few months off after that and really realized that learning programming in the context of the crypto space was the only way I would commit to it. 
- :monocle_face: I started learning Solidity in April/May 2021 and have been on it on a near daily basis since. When I deployed my first smart contract on the Rinkeby test net, I realized this is what would make me feel fulfilled.
- :purple_heart: Iâ€™m really looking for any solid opportunity to use these skills that I learned/am learning. Hard work isn't a deterrent to me. My dream would be to be to work in crypto full time.
- :computer: Current Technologies: Solidity, Truffle, Ganache, minor experience in React.js/Next.js, and Git/Github at the moment. More will be added as I become more experienced.
